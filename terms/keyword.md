# Definition

Keywords are words that have a predefined  meaning in a programming language. Keywords are reserved words that developers or programmers cannot use as the name of something for example variables, constants, and [functions](function.md) in most [programming languages](programming-language.md).

Basically, any part of the [syntax](syntax.md) where the developer has the option to use any name they choose must not clash with the reserved words of that language. They convey a specific instruction and so using it as a name of something in your code might lead to confusion during compile time.

## Use Cases and Examples

For example, some of the keywords in the C programming language include: 
- **int:** Highlights that the variable will hold an integer value.
- **long:** Highlights that the variable will hold a large integer value.
- **break:** Used to immediately terminate any [loop](loop.md) or [iteration](loop.md).
- **if:** Allows the program to enter the specific code section once certain conditions are met.

All the above keywords are frequently used by programmers while writing C [code](code.md). Keywords can be different between programming languages but many languages share common keywords like `if`.

## Summary

Keywords in a programming language are usually the key things that help a [compiler](compiler.md) or [interpreter](interpreter.md) break down code into an [abstract syntax tree](abstract-syntax-tree.md) to further convert  the code into instructions the computer can execute.
