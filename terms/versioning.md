## Definition 

Versioning is the process of assigning a label (usually a unique number) to [software](software.md) at a given time to mark a completed stage in its development. 

No new features or code will be added to this version of the software. The same thing happens to newer versions of the software. This way developers can move between versions.  

## Use Cases and Examples

Versioning acts just like [timestamps](timestamp.md) in movies. It allows you to go back and forth between different stages of your software.

[Version control](version-control.md) tools make it easy to move between versions of your software without necessarily creating duplicate copies. 

Working with versioned software helps customers follow up with software improvements and know when and if they should upgrade. 

Software teams can also move back to older versions if a newer version appears to be defective. 

There are different types of versioning approaches. One popular type is [Semver](semver.md).

## Summary

Versioning is sometimes used to mark the release of new features or fixes to a software system.
