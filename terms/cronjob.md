## Definition
A Cron Job is what you set up if you need a script or piece of code to be executed sometime in the future, once or at intervals.


## Use cases and Examples
Cron jobs are usually set up to run tasks at regular intervals. This includes things like backing up data on a [server](server.md) or sending out emails.

[Operating systems](operating-system.md) like Linux allows you to do this from the command line. In this case the script to be run is scripted using [shell](shell-scripting.md).

## Summary
Without cronjobs, tasks that need to recur regularly will require a human, either the end-user or developer, to trigger the task.
