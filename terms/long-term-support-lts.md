## Definition

Software is said to have a **long term support (LTS)** if its creators decide to fix any [bug](bug.md),  issues that arise as well as provide general support over a period longer than they typically would.

## Use Cases and Examples
Most software products usually provide LTS for their most popular product [versions](versioning.md) when a new version is about to be released.
This way users of the old version have enough time to transition to the newer one.
Some software companies may also be paid by their bigger clients to provide an LTS if moving to a newer version is not feasible for them.
