## Definition
A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of code in the form of a library or utility, that development can use in other to easily integrate another piece of software.

Instead of just providing a document describing how another team can implement some piece of software, they anticipate the possible use cases and create [boilerplate](boilerplate.md) code that others can then use.

## Use cases and Examples
A popular use of SDKs is to integrate [API](api.md) services like the one [payment processors](payment-processor.md) provide.
