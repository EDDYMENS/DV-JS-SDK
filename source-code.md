## Definition
Source code is the collection of code or a string of text files that make up a program.

A program is a set of instructions and statements produced by a programmer in a [computer programming language](programming-language.md). Another program called a [compiler](compiler.md) or [interpreter](interpreter.md) then converts this code into something the computer better understands called machine language.

To write source code. Programmers can use a text editor, a visual programming tool, or an integrated development environment (IDE).

## Use cases and Examples

```Here is an example of the source code for a Hello World program in C language:
/* Hello World program */
#include<stdio.h>
main ()
{
print ("Hello World");
}
```

Above is an example of a source code in the C programming language and this is a simple program it's meant to output the words `Hello World.` on the screen. 
For bigger and more complex programs the source code usually spans multiple lines and or multiple files.

## Summary
Source code is one of the core parts of a program a programmer works on. It includes declarations, instructions, [functions](function.md), [loops](loop.md), and other statements that might be particular to the programming language in use.
